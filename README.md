# OpenSkyEngine
OpenSkyEngine is a Vulkan 3D engine being made by Sairam in his free time.

# How to compile?
You can find build.bat, which can be used to make a build. 
Requirements:
CMake, Visual Studio Build Tools 2019.

First, run Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2019
Then, navigate to the location where build.bat exists.
Then, just type in build, and a new build should be generated in Build directory.
Run the TestProject.exe and enjoy!

Let me know if you found a way to build this with MinGW GCC compiler.

Thank you for trying my project out!
